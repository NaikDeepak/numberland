# Active Context - Numberland Adventures

## Current Status: PLANNING PHASE - TDD APPROACH WITH DESIGN SPECIFICATIONS

### Immediate Focus
Building a comprehensive plan for the Numberland Adventures PoC development using **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** approach over the next 2 weeks, incorporating the new **playful, kid-friendly design specifications**.

### Recent Decisions
- **Framework Choice**: React Web (Next.js) over React Native for faster PoC development
- **Backend**: Firebase suite for authentication, database, and hosting
- **UI Framework**: Tailwind CSS for rapid development with custom design system
- **Language**: TypeScript for type safety and better development experience
- **Development Approach**: **TDD (Test-Driven Development)** - Write failing tests first, then implement code
- **Design System**: Bright, playful color palette with cartoon elements and adventure theme
- **Animation Library**: Framer Motion for smooth, engaging animations

### Design Specifications Integration
- **Color Palette**: Bright Blue (#4A90E2), Sunny Yellow (#FFD93D), Fresh Green (#6BCB77), Soft Red (#FF6B6B)
- **Visual Style**: Rounded corners (2xl), cartoon icons, adventure theme
- **UX Rules**: Short text, icons + audio cues, one task per screen, large tappable elements
- **Asset Requirements**: Cartoon explorer avatars, treasure chest icons, jungle/island backgrounds

### TDD Workflow
1. **Write Failing Test**: Define expected behavior with test
2. **Write Minimal Code**: Implement just enough to make test pass
3. **Refactor**: Clean up code while keeping tests green
4. **Repeat**: Move to next feature
