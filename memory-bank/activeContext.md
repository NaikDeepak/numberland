# Active Context - Numberland Adventures

## Current Status: PLANNING PHASE - TDD APPROACH

### Immediate Focus
Building a comprehensive plan for the Numberland Adventures PoC development using **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** approach over the next 2 weeks.

### Recent Decisions
- **Framework Choice**: React Web (Next.js) over React Native for faster PoC development
- **Backend**: Firebase suite for authentication, database, and hosting
- **UI Framework**: Tailwind CSS for rapid development
- **Language**: TypeScript for type safety and better development experience
- **Development Approach**: **TDD (Test-Driven Development)** - Write failing tests first, then implement code

### TDD Workflow
1. **Write Failing Test**: Define expected behavior with test
2. **Write Minimal Code**: Implement just enough to make test pass
3. **Refactor**: Clean up code while keeping tests green
4. **Repeat**: Move to next feature

## Technical Decisions Made

### Architecture
- **Frontend**: Next.js with TypeScript for type safety
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for rapid development
- **State Management**: React Context + useReducer
- **Backend**: Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Hosting)
- **Deployment**: Vercel for Next.js hosting
- **Testing**: **TDD approach with Jest, React Testing Library, and MSW**

### Data Models
- **Student**: User profile with progress tracking
- **Quest**: Daily problem sets with difficulty levels
- **MathProblem**: Individual problems with types and answers
- **Teacher**: User profile with class management
- **Class**: Group of students with shared settings

### UI/UX Approach
- **Mobile-first**: Responsive design for all devices
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 compliance
- **Performance**: Fast loading and smooth interactions
- **Kid-friendly**: Large touch targets, bright colors, simple navigation

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Component rendering, utility functions, data transformations
- **Integration Tests**: Authentication flow, database operations, API endpoints
- **E2E Tests**: Complete user flows, cross-browser compatibility
- **Test Coverage**: Target >90% for critical paths

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Today) - TDD Approach

   - Implement routing based on test requirements
   - Write tests for authentication context
   - Implement authentication context provider
   - Write tests for basic layout components
   - Implement layout components

3. **Authentication Foundation with Tests**

- [ ] Deploy to production with monitoring and alerting tests

## Key Considerations

### Technical Challenges
- **Real-time Updates**: Firebase Firestore for live progress tracking
- **Offline Support**: Consider PWA capabilities for basic offline functionality
- **Performance**: Optimize for mobile devices and slower connections
- **Security**: Implement proper authentication and data validation
- **Testing Complexity**: Mocking Firebase and external dependencies

### UX Challenges
- **Kid-Friendly Interface**: Design for young users with limited reading skills
- **Engagement**: Keep the 5-minute daily quest engaging and rewarding
- **Accessibility**: Support for various learning needs and abilities
- **Teacher Simplicity**: Make setup and monitoring easy for teachers

### Business Considerations
- **Data Privacy**: COPPA compliance for children's data
- **Scalability**: Design for potential growth and additional features
- **Cost**: Firebase usage optimization for budget constraints
- **Maintenance**: Simple deployment and update process

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Firebase Complexity**: Start with simple implementations, add complexity gradually
- **Performance Issues**: Implement lazy loading and code splitting from the start
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Use Firebase security rules and input validation
- **Deployment Issues**: Use Vercel for reliable deployment
- **Testing Complexity**: Use MSW for API mocking and comprehensive test utilities

### UX Risks
- **User Confusion**: Keep interfaces simple and intuitive
- **Engagement Drop**: Focus on immediate rewards and progress visibility
- **Teacher Adoption**: Provide clear setup instructions and support
- **Accessibility Issues**: Test with various user needs and devices
