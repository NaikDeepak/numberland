# Numberland Adventures - Project Brief

## Project Overview
**Numberland Adventures** is a gamified daily math app for primary grade students (ages 5-10) designed to make foundational math practice fun, rewarding, and low-pressure. The app supports both individual student use and basic classroom management for teachers.

## Core Mission
Transform daily math practice into an engaging adventure that builds confidence and foundational skills through:
- 5-minute daily quests
- Immediate visual rewards and feedback
- Progressive difficulty and skill building
- Teacher-friendly progress tracking

## Target Users
### Primary: Students (Ages 5-10)
- **Grade Levels**: K-4 (Kindergarten to 4th Grade)
- **Learning Style**: Visual, kinesthetic, reward-driven
- **Attention Span**: 5-10 minutes per session
- **Tech Comfort**: Basic touch/swipe interactions

### Secondary: Teachers
- **Tech Comfort**: Basic digital tools
- **Needs**: Simple progress tracking, class management
- **Time Constraints**: Quick setup and monitoring

## MVP Goals (2-Week PoC)
1. **Student Experience**
   - Simple login (name/class code)
   - Daily quest with 5 math problems
   - Immediate feedback and rewards
   - Progress visualization (coins, streaks)

2. **Teacher Experience**
   - Basic dashboard with student list
   - Accuracy and streak tracking
   - Simple class management

3. **Technical Foundation**
   - React Native or React Web
   - Firebase backend (Auth, Firestore, Hosting)
   - Static math problems (Grade 1-2 level)
   - Basic gamification system

## Success Metrics
- **Engagement**: Daily active usage
- **Learning**: Accuracy improvement over time
- **Retention**: Streak maintenance
- **Adoption**: Teacher and student satisfaction

## Constraints & Considerations
- **Privacy**: COPPA compliance for children's data
- **Accessibility**: Support for non-readers (visual/audio)
- **Performance**: Fast loading on basic devices
- **Simplicity**: Minimal complexity for teachers
- **Offline**: Consider low-resource school environments

## Future Vision (Post-PoC)
- Adaptive difficulty engine
- Custom avatars and story modes
- Audio narration and voice features
- Offline support
- Advanced analytics and reporting
